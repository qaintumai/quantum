"""
This module initializes and defines the public API for the layers package. The package
contains various classes and functions used for the quantum transfomer and QNN, including
embedding layers, attention mechanisms, quantum neural networks, and utility functions
for initializing weights and encoding data. This API is intended to allow users to design
their own Quantum learning models using the libraries below.

Usage:
To import the entire API from layers:
    from layers import *
